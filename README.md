# Tournament-based Random Forest
This repository contains an implementation of a modified Random Forest algorithm for classification tasks.
During the construction of each tree, feature tests are selected using a <b>tournament selection</b> mechanism — two candidate tests are randomly chosen, their quality is evaluated, and the better one is applied.
This approach introduces a balance between randomness and informed choice, potentially improving model performance.
